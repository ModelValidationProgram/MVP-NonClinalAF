Example of the outputs that will be archived upon publication. A number of intermedicate outputs and visualizations will be provided for people who would like to use the simulations for their research.

The following files were too large to sync to github but will be archived with the simulations:

1231094_genotypes.lfmm

1231094_RDA_structcorr.RDS

1231094_RDA.RDS

1231094_plusneut_MAF01.recode2.vcf.gz

1231094.trees

1231094_Rout_Gmat_sample.txt

For information on all the files in this folder, see the `sim_ouput_20220428_metadata` folder
