Two-phenotype two-environment simulations IBD

The **figures\/** directory provides figures that are output from analyses.

The **inputfiles\/** directory has the real BC environments that are used as input files in the SLiM simulations.

The **results\/** directory contains output from the SLiM simulations, which are used for analysis using genome scan methods as well as data visualization to parameterize simulations.

The **simfiles\/** directory contains the simulation file I've been using/tweaking to run our two phenotype-two environment model.

The **src\/** directory contains scripts to process and visualize SLiM output.
