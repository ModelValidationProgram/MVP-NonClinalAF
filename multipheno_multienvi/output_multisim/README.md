## Results

Files with **\*outputIndAll\*** have the geographic location, phenotype values (for phenotype0 and phenotyp1), and environment values (for both environments).

Files with **\*outputMutsx\*** have the position, selection coefficient, origin generation, type, and frequency of mx mutation. 

Files with **\*outputPhenEnv\*** have the sample size, mean, standard deviation, and correlations of both phenotypes with both environments.

Files with **\*outputSim\*** have the seed, overall correlations, recombination rates, mutation rate, and sample size for the simulation. This could probably be combined with simulation_parameters files that was created by BF.

Files with **\*outputm2effects\*** have the frequencies, effects, position, and origin generation for all m2 mutations. Earlier versions of this output file did not have position or OriginGen.

Files with **\*simulation_parameters\*** has the values for all parameters in the slim simulation.
