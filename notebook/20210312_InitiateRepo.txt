* transfered 20200224_Multi_m0.05_CG_2phen_2envi_5x10_coastline_keep.slim from repo MVP_prelim
and renamed it Case1_CoreSimEstuary2TraitsWithPleiotropy.slim

Plan:

Part 1:
- run this sim
- run the R Markdown on the output, make sure it works
- add neutral mutations with pyslim
- run the RDA, see if can ID adaptive alleles
- add OutFLANK code

Part 2:
- Expand this case to the 2 traits without pleiotropy
- Expand this case to the 1 trait without pleiotropy
