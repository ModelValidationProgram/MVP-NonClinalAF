# YYYYMMDD 


### Plan:	
[] add neutral mutations with pyslim
[] show that RDA can predict individuals environments when we know the adaptive architecture perfectly
[] show that RDA gets messed up when adding complex environments
	[] add color to RDA plots to show the temp and salinity optimums of individuals - maybe use green to blue for salinity and light to dark for temperature
[] ID outliers with LFMM - TEST IF RDA CAN PREDICT IND ENVIIRONMENTS
[] ID outliers with RDA - TEST IF RDA CAN PREDICT IND ENVIIRONMENTS
[] ID outliers with OUTFLANK - TEST IF RDA CAN PREDICT IND ENVIIRONMENTS

Graph improvements:
* fix heat maps so the colors are constrained

## Pyslim

`pip install pyslim`

`Successfully installed humanize-3.2.0 kastore-0.3.1 msprime-0.7.4 pyslim-0.600 svgwrite-1.4.1 tskit-0.3.4`

* copied pyslim script from neutral recombination paper

```
cd /Users/lotterhos/Documents/GitHub/MVP-NonClinalAF/src
python
```

```
Python 3.7.4 (default, Aug 13 2019, 15:17:50)
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

* recapitation started at 6:47am
* it didn't finish by 11:45am. I think this is the issue Aki ran into -

## three ideas to flush out

- two types of demography
	- oyster estuary
	- 2D trees

- 3 subcategories of demography
	- equal N, equal m
	- N cline
	- m variable

- categories of architecture
	- pleiotropy with selection (no genetic correlation)
	- no pleiotropy with selection
	- equal fitness (control - genetic drift)
	- pleiotropy with selection (+ genetic correlation)
	- pleiotropy with selection (- genetic correlation)
	- 2 traits with plasticity

Other idea - maybe use multivariate distance as a prediction of the multivariate trait from the RDA?

### Q: how to predict optimal salinity of an individual from multiple RDA axes?
A: predicted environment phenotype is the RDA loading * eigenvalue of axis * loading of environment on that axis
