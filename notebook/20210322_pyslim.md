## Getting recantation to work

```
cd /Users/lotterhos/Documents/GitHub/MVP-NonClinalAF/src
python
```

```
seed = '2549986039929'
r = 1e-6
N = 100
mu = 1e-7
```

Starting with this code:

SUCCESS!!!

Plan:
[] edit R code to input all mutations file
[] Add LFMM to R code to quantify how often adaptive alleles are (1) not clinal or (2) clinal but not significant, or (3) clinal and outlier

	[] show that RDA gets messed up when adding complex environments
	[] add color to RDA plots to show the temp and salinity optimums of individuals - maybe use green to blue for salinity and light to dark for temperature
	[] ID outliers with LFMM - TEST IF RDA CAN PREDICT IND ENVIRONMENTS
	[] ID outliers with RDA - TEST IF RDA CAN PREDICT IND ENVIRONMENTS
	[] fix heat maps so the colors are constrained

[] set up a data frame of scenarios

[] Tweak unix pipeline to run a scenario quickly

[] test some of the other scenarios I want to create
