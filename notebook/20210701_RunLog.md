# SLiM parameter run log


### 2021 - July - 1 (UPDATE July 8)

**UPDATE - July 8th** : After letting this run for a couple of days using `100G` and up to `24H` per sim on the `short` partition it still looks like some of the simulations are still reaching the time limit before completing. To avoid this issue I am starting to run the sims on `lotterhos` which has no time limit and with less resources (so there are at least some for others to use). My plan is to run 10 simulations simultaneously using 30G of ram. (300G total) and see how long it takes to complete the first 50 simulations.

**UPDATE - July 1st** : I ran this on the `short` discovery partition without specifying a timelimit and only using 30G of ram per simulation. As a result, it looks like many of the simulations timed out before finishing. I revised the shell script by increasing the ram (1ooG per sim) and setting an explicit time limit (23 hours) per simulation and limiting the number of simulations running simultaneously to 5. This hopefully will be sufficient for the simulations to complete without timing out. However, it does mean that running all the sims will take substantially longer.

Description: Ran 150 slim simulations (first 150 rows of [parameter list](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/MVP-NonClinalAF/blob/alan/src/0b-final_params.txt)). With `N=1000` for pyslim.
