# Update on status of MVP model - Jul 9th 2021

I currently have the MVP model running on the lotterhos partition. See the [run log](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/MVP-NonClinalAF/blob/alan/notebook/20210701_RunLog.md) for details. As of 11AM it is currently actively process or completed the first 20 simulations from the standard parameters list. I set it up to run up to the first 50 simulations.
