# Intial results from 20210920 run

I know that some of these sims (particularly in the longrun list) will not have produced all necessary results, because I ran out of disk space mid-run
(partially caused by large files from previous results). It will be hard to disentangle those that didn't work because we ran of of disk space from those that 
didn't work for other reasons, so that's just something to keep in mind.


### Sims that didn't finish
Very few of the simulations finished all 10 replicates. Those that had the fewest replicates were:

Demographies
- Est clines N-variable, m-variable
- Est clines N-equal m_breaks
- SS clines and SS mtn, N-equal, m_breaks

Architectures
- the highly polygenic architectures

## issues with initial analysis

- It's unclear how to represent results as a proportion of Va, since a very large number of causal loci were filtered out in the polygenic scenarios
