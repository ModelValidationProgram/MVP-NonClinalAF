# Intial results from 20210920 run

I know that some of these sims (particularly in the longrun list) will not have produced all necessary results, because I ran out of disk space mid-run
(partially caused by large files from previous results). It will be hard to disentangle those that didn't work because we ran of of disk space from those that 
didn't work for other reasons, so that's just something to keep in mind.


### Sims that didn't finish
Very few of the simulations finished all 10 replicates. Those that had the fewest replicates were:

Demographies
- Est clines N-variable, m-variable
- Est clines N-equal m_breaks
- SS clines and SS mtn, N-equal, m_breaks

Architectures
- the highly polygenic architectures

## Sims to Do
- N equal\nm breaks producing twice as many SNPs everything else - make it so reduced migration is not across 3 populations, but 2
-  N variable\nm variable - reduce low m scenarios

## issues with initial analysis - R code to Do

- It's unclear how to represent results as a proportion of Va, since a very large number of causal loci were filtered out in the polygenic scenarios
  - add Va calc with and without filtered loci
- Pop plots 
   - the migration/Ne plot is too short
   - remove numbers from the optimums plot
 - Phen-env Af-env plots
   -  there seems to be a bug in the in the color ramp plotting legend (did I pick colors randomly?), the prop. VA plot, and in the legend for prop. Va
 -  Number of neutral SNPs in demographies
   -    N equal\nm breaks producing twice as much as everything else
   -    N variable\nm variable produces on average the same number of SNPs, but sometimes produces 100,000 SNPs
- output: "X....RDA1_temp_cor"
- RDA plot too busy - black diamonds
- Calculate FST for the sims 
- FIX RDA MUTATION PREDICTION

# Graphs TO DO:
- Put together a 10x2 figure for the SS and Est demographies
- The phenotypic clines, AF clines, and heatmap figure
- LFMM figures - what to show?
- RDA figure 1 - demography histograms, demography scatterplots
- RDA figure 2 - a 6 panel plot - SS Clines, SS Mtn, and Est - mutation loading on top, individual scores on bottom
  - create main text figure for simple scenarios
  - create a supplemental figure for the complex scenarios
