Looks good!

## Inspecting sim 1231118 - change to R code

`"Error 2: order of mutations wrong"`
Hm, that's odd. Let's inspect.

The line that failed was a sanity check, and it failed because more than one mutation arose at the same position in the simulation. The rest of the sim processed normally once I removed this line, which was not really needed because it was redundant with other checks.

## Additional change to R code

I added a line to output the G matrix for the subsample of individuals and filtered SNPs.

## Inspecting sim 1231103
Well, one issue with this sim is that it calculated K as -Inf!
I created a new rule for K, in that if the old rule didnt' work to find K, use a slightly modified rule. 

## Inspecting sim 1231723

Can't figure out what's wrong

## Check distribution of FST across sims

## 
I think FST is too high in some of the simulations, and migration should be increased. For example, the N-variable m-variable gives a mean FST of 0.74!

I should aim for an FST of 0.05-0.2 across all simulations.
