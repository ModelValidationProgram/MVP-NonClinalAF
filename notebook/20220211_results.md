## Failed sims

# Some sims (~50) still failed due to low number of SNPs after sampling

## Review recombination rate
* defineConstant("R", 1e-6);
* Each LG 50000 sites, 20 LGs
* N = 100 * 100 = 10,000

* $N_er$ = 10,000 * 1e-06 = 0.01 which gives a resolution of 0.001 cM between proximate bases.
* Length: 0.001 cM * 50,000 sites = 50 cM

We simulated 21 linkage groups (LGs), each 10 cM long, with a resolution of 0.0001 cM between proximate bases in SLiM. 
In 20 of the LGs QTN mutations could arise, and the 21st was neutral. Thus, our simulations represent the case where unlinked locations 
affected by selection were tracked within a much larger genome. The recombination rate was scaled to mimic the case where SNPs were 
collected across each LG (similar to a SNP chip), but still low enough to allow signatures of selection to arise in neutral loci 
linked to selected loci (in the simulations 100,000 bases was 10 cM; in humans 100,000 bp would correspond to 0.1 cM). 


From Lotterhos 2019:

The base recombination rate Ner = 0.01 (unless manipulated as described below) gave a resolution of 0.001 cM between proximate bases. 
The recombination rate was scaled to mimic the case where SNPs were collected across a larger genetic map than what was simulated 
(similar to a SNP chip), but still low enough to allow signatures of selection to arise in neutral loci linked to selected loci 
(in the simulations 50,000 bases / (r = 1e-05) * 100 = 50 cM; in humans 50,000 bp would correspond to 0.05 cM). 
Thus, SNPs at the opposite ends of linkage groups were likely to have a recombination rate between them of 0.5 (unlinked), 
but there would otherwise be some degree of linkage among SNPs within linkage groups. 
For all LGs, the population-scaled mutation rate NeÎ¼ equaled 0.001.

Wow, Fst for N-variable m-variable was all over the place!

## New SLiM simulations

This is really confusing, given the much higher FST, that the number of SNPs is still very small.

One way to reduce variation is to sample from fewer migration rates, and change the way N is sampled.


Old params: `var_m_ss = c(rep(0.001,3), rep(0.01,10),rep(0.1,5),rep(0.25,1));`

New params: `var_m_ss = c(rep(0.01,10), rep(0.1,5));` (mean 0.04)

I revised the code so that equal numbers of high and low N demes would be chosen:
`N_var = sample(rep(N,10), 100, replace=FALSE)`
`sim.addSubpop(i, N_var[i-1]); // variable N`

I also edited the R code so it wouldn't break if there was low diversity in the simulation.
