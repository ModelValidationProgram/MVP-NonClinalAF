I'm still working on trying to get the right parameters for the variable N, variable m scenario.
I deleted all the previous simulations, so I could focus on these.

New params for Estuary:
```
	var_m_estuary_x = c(0.1, 0.25, rep(0.49, 8));
	var_m_estuary_y = c(0.03, rep(0.07,5), 0.25);
	mig_breaks_estuary = 0.03;
```

New params for SS:
```
  var_m_ss = c(0.01, rep(0.03,8), 0.25);
	mig_breaks_SS = 0.01;
```

Just running the first 30 sims for each parameter, see if they work...

Ahah! There was a bug in `N_var`. By the end of the last post, the simulations were failing, but I didn't know it because I was lazy and just trying to overwrite 
older sims. However, the new sims were failing and not overwriting the old sims, which is why I kept seeing the same weird results.

```
ls -l *outfile.txt | wc -l # 60

ls -l *_muts.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that completed the SliM run #60

ls -l *_plusneut_MAF01.recode2.vcf.gz | wc -l #60

ls *_pdf_1pop.pdf | wc -l # number of sims that were analyzed through the population step 60

ls -l *_Rout_simSummary.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that were analyzed through the final output in the R script 60

awk 'NR==1' 1231094_Rout_simSummary.txt > ../summary_20220201.txt # header

awk 'FNR>1' *_Rout_simSummary.txt >> ../summary_20220201.txt # data
```

## Rerun to get lower FST for Est_clines N-variable m-variable

Old code: `var_m_estuary_x = c(0.1, 0.25, rep(0.49, 8));`
New code: `var_m_estuary_x = c(0.25, rep(0.49, 5));`

## I think we're ready to scale up!

I deleted all the simulation outputs, just to be safe!

Edited these for correct files and number in the array:
```
sbatch d-run_nonAF_sims_0Slim-fastruns-20220201.sh #1000 lines
sbatch d-run_nonAF_sims_0Slim-longruns-20220201.sh #301 lines
```

When those are done, run these:
```
sbatch d-run_nonAF_sims_0Slim-fastruns-20220201-b.sh #952 lines
```

long runs jobID: 23329636

b runs jobID: 23345787


When those are done, check outputs:
```
ls -l *outfile.txt | wc -l # 60

ls -l *_muts.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that completed the SliM run #60

ls -l *_plusneut_MAF01.recode2.vcf.gz | wc -l #2250 whoo hoooo
```

If that looks good, analyze the sims in R:
```
sbatch e-run_nonAF_sims_1R-fastruns-20220201.sh # Submitted batch job 23356972
sbatch e-run_nonAF_sims_1R-longruns-20220201.sh # Submitted batch job 23367535
```

```
sbatch e-run_nonAF_sims_1R-fastruns-20220201-b.sh
```

Check what's done: 
```
ls *_pdf_1pop.pdf | wc -l # number of sims that were analyzed through the population step 

ls -l *_Rout_simSummary.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that were analyzed through the final output in the R script 2249 (YEAH)
```

Create final output:
```
awk 'NR==1' 1231094_Rout_simSummary.txt > ../summary_20220201.txt # header

awk 'FNR>1' *_Rout_simSummary.txt >> ../summary_20220201.txt # data
```
