I'm still working on trying to get the right parameters for the variable N, variable m scenario.
I deleted all the previous simulations, so I could focus on these.

New params for Estuary:
```
	var_m_estuary_x = c(0.1, 0.25, rep(0.49, 8));
	var_m_estuary_y = c(0.03, rep(0.07,5), 0.25);
	mig_breaks_estuary = 0.03;
```

New params for SS:
```
  var_m_ss = c(0.01, rep(0.03,8), 0.25);
	mig_breaks_SS = 0.01;
```

Just running the first 30 sims for each parameter, see if they work...

Ahah! There was a bug in `N_var`. By the end of the last post, the simulations were failing, but I didn't know it because I was lazy and just trying to overwrite 
older sims. However, the new sims were failing and not overwriting the old sims, which is why I kept seeing the same weird results.

```
ls -l *outfile.txt | wc -l #

ls -l *_muts.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that completed the SliM run #15

ls -l *_plusneut_MAF01.recode2.vcf.gz | wc -l #15

ls *_pdf_1pop.pdf | wc -l # number of sims that were analyzed through the population step 1254

ls -l *_Rout_simSummary.txt | wc -l # this is the number of sims that were analyzed through the final output in the R script 1188

awk 'NR==1' 1231094_Rout_simSummary.txt > ../summary_20220201.txt # header

awk 'FNR>1' *_Rout_simSummary.txt >> ../summary_20220201.txt # data
```
