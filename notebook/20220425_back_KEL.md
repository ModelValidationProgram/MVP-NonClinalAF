After a long hiatus of getting other papers out, I'm back!

Today I went through the rest of the R code, and made some more graphs for the main paper.

Next steps to do is to tweak a couple of things in the R code that I use to process the sims, and check a few outputs.

The main thing left is to implement the structure correction for RDA, and a few tweaks to make sure that I have the correct. 

### Sync github
TO DO

### RDA
- [ ] RDA code to use https://github.com/Capblancq/RDA-landscape-genomics
- [ ] implement structure correction for RDA
- [ ] RDA - compare the ancestral/derived signed approach (what was used in Laruson) to the MAF signed approach

### Minor tweaks
- [ ] check FDR calculation is (FP/(TP + FP))
- [ ] use the LG group and the position to name loci. And since mutations can occur on these same positions in the sims, I add a number so that my rownames are unique.
- [ ] fix LG column of muts output. I noticed that one of the new muts files has some values in the LG column as missing, when this wasnâ€™t the case in the first file you gave me.
first file = /work/lotterhos/MVP-Offsets/practice_slim/mypractice/1231094_Rout_muts_full.txt
new muts = /work/lotterhos/MVP-Offsets/mypractice_20210308/slimdir/1231096_Rout_muts_full.txt

### Think about possible change
- [ ] think about N-equal, m-breaks scenario. not really giving different FST or K, difference in structure only slight
