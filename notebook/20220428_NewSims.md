## Run R Scripts

  * My initial run of this job did not finish for all simulations. The first sim that failed only had 1 trait simulated, there was a bug in some of the new RDA code for 1 trait that I fixed. Rerunning: 

Submitted batch job 25301780

* Some of the scripts are taking an unusually long time to run... it could be that I need to request more memory for these jobs.
      25301780_8 lotterhos R-Run-20 lotterho  R 3-03:26:35      1 d3037 #seed 1231102
      25301780_12 lotterhos R-Run-20 lotterho  R 3-03:26:35      1 d3037

* Also, Brandon messaged me today with a potential issue with the MAF filtering. I forgot to filter loci with allele frequency > 0.99, which still have MAF!

* Investigating why seed 1231102 takes a long time - using 2 cores and 32GB memory for R Studio
 * number of loci 32,000 - on scale with other sims
 * Potential problem with while loop used to remove dup names - it went on forever!
```
  while (sum(duplicated(vcf_full@fix[,"INFO"]))>0){
    dups <- which(duplicated(vcf_full@fix[,"INFO"]))
    vcf_full@fix[dups,"INFO"] <- gsub("_2",paste0("_",b),x = vcf_full@fix[dups,"INFO"])
    b <- b+1
  }
```
 * The loop didn't work for loci with 3 duplicate names. I fixed it:
```
  while (sum(duplicated(vcf_full@fix[,"INFO"]))>0){
    dups <- which(duplicated(vcf_full@fix[,"INFO"]))
    vcf_full@fix[dups,"INFO"] <- gsub(paste0("_",b-1),
                                      paste0("_",b),
                                      x = vcf_full@fix[dups,"INFO"])
    b <- b+1
    if (b==10){print("problem in naming loci"); break}
  }
```

I canceled the current runs that were probably looping forever --- `scancel    25301780`
