Thoughts: 

* jacknife with groups of loci to explore which explain local adaptation

* Do the same as above, but only for outlier loci

* try looking at power of LFMM vs. correlation with U1, instead of FDR
* for individual loci, try looking at outlier status or -log10 P value vs. correlation with U1
