# From Brandon last week: 

sanity check - the following loci are not in the same order between the mutname column in
`{seed}_Rout_muts_full.txt` and rownames for `{seed}_Rout_Gmat_sample.txt`

this happens to be seed 1231094. But I also found mismatches in other seeds.

I found the bug!

It was near the end of the code when I was reordering the data for a color ramp. 
Old: `muts_full <- muts_full1[order(muts_full1$pos_pyslim),]` #ordering based on pyslim order can induce problems if mutations at same site 
Correct: `muts_full <- muts_full1[order(muts_full1$VCFrow),]` #ordering based on VCF row fixes the problem!

# Checking code

adding `if(!identical(as.character(muts_full$mutname), as.character(rownames(G_full_subset)))){print("Error 1g: mutations not lined up");break()}` every 50 lines

# Bug

My notes here were lost, but the bug was discovered when making a plot near the end of the code. I had sorted the data by position from SliM, and some loci had the same position so it might have mixed them up in the order. So it was an ordering problem, but all the row names were correct.

I'm going to rerun the simulations after I get reviews back.
