## Using old TTT code
`TTT_2pheno_2envi` renamed ---> `MVP_multipheno_multienvi`

### To do in slim / on computer:
- [x] check SLiM version is the same as OOD
- [ ] update to dmv_norm
- [ ] output mutation effect size table
- [ ] output individual environments and phenotypes table
- [ ] output mutation vcf file
- [ ] compare parameters to the MVP simulation
- [ ] use tree sequencing to recap and output VCF - see Recombination paper

### In R:
- [ ] run RDA and test ideas with the 2 trait sims
- [ ] evaluate clinal paradigm with proportion of causal clines
- [ ] add non-adaptive environments to RDA and test it

## Expand sim to multiple traits
- [ ] for simplicity just have one mutation type and pleiotropic mutations, no trade-offs
