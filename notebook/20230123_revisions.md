## 20230120

A number of tweaks were made to the tutorial and the multivariate
simulation code, which are documented in the response to reviewers.

Cross-checking all the metadata and code is synced to github:

- [ ] sync github with laptop - make sure no lingering changes on the HPC

- [x] Tutorial
	- [ ] check that someone can reproduce it
- [ ] `README.md` - revisit this after deciding whether to keep the figures and example folder
- [x] `summary_20220428_20220726_RDApredictions.txt_metadata.md`
- [ ] `summary_20220428_20220726.txt_metadata.md`
	- revisit this after syncing - there's an "a" version on my laptop, but not in the .RMD?
- [x] `summary_LAcalc_20220428_20220726.txt_metadata.md`
- [x] `summary_LAthroughtime_20220428_20220726.txt_metadata.md`

- [ ] `/sim_ouput_20220428_metadata/` 
- [ ] README.md
- [x] seed_ind.txt_metadata.md
- [ ] seed_info.txt_metadata.md
		- I checked it, but double check the numbering on $sigma_K$ in the newer outputs
- [x] seed_LA.txt_metadata.md
- [x] seed_muts.txt_metadata.md
- [x] seed_popInfo_m.txt_metadata.md
- [ ] seed_popInfo.txt_metadata.md
		- I checked it, but double check the numbering on $opt_0$ in the newer outputs
- [x] seed_Rout_af_pop.txt_metadata.md
- [x] seed_Rout_af_sal.txt_metadata.md
- [x] seed_Rout_af_temp.txt_metadata.md
- [ ] seed_Rout_ind_subset.txt_metadata.md
- [ ] seed_Rout_muts_full.txt_metadata.md
- [x] seed_Rout_RDA_predictions.txt_metadata.md
