### seed_LA.txt (SLiM output) This file tracks the amount of local adaptation in the simulation through time

* `seed` simulation seed
* `gen` generation
* `sympatric`  average fitness of demes in sympatry
* `allopatric` average fitness of demes in allopatry
* `local_adapt` amount of local adaptation (`allopatric` - `sympatric` )
* `mean_phen0` mean of first phenotype (salinity in this simulation) across the whole metapopulation (should be near 0)
* `mean_phen1` mean of second phenotype (temperature in this simulation) across the whole metapopulation (should be near 0)
* `cor_sal_popmean` correlation between salinity and population mean phenotype (often inflated due to central limit theorem)
* `cor_temp_popmean` correlation between temperature and population mean phenotype (often inflated due to central limit theorem)
* `cor_sal_ind` correlation between salinity and individual phenotypes
* `cor_temp_ind` correlation between temperature and individual phenotypes
