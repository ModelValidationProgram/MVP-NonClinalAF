### seed_Rout_RDA_predictions.txt (output after analysis of simulations)

correlation between (a linear prediction of the weighted RDA loadings) and (the individual's temp phenotype)

Note that `Env2` in the manuscript was called `salinity` or `sal` in the simulations

* `nloci` the number of loci randomly sampled from the genome
* `Random_cor_temppredict_tempphen` the correlation between the RDA temperature prediction for an individual based on a random set of loci (Eq 1 in main paper) and the temperature phenotype of an individual
* `Random_cor_salpredict_salphen` the correlation between the RDA salinity prediction for an individual based on a random set of loci (Eq 1 in main paper) and the salinity phenotype of an individual
* `Random_cor_RDAtemppredict_tempphen_structcorr` same as the 2nd column, but for the RDA model with structure correction
* `Random_cor_RDAsalpredict_salphen_structcorr` same as the 3rd column, but for the RDA model with structure correction
