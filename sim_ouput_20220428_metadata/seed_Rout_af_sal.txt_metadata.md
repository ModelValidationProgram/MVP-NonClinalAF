### seed_Rout_af_sal.txt (output after analysis of simulations)

Allele freq. of all populations with the same salinity (Env2), for each mutation after 
sampling of individuals (10 ind/deme x 100 demes) and filtering MAF > 0.01


* Allele frequency as a function of salinity (Env2) for each mutation 
* rows are salinity (Env2) values
* columns are mutations in `seed_Rout_muts_full.txt`
