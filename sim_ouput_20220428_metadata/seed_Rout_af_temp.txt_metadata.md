### seed_Rout_af_temp.txt (output after analysis of simulations)

Allele freq. of all populations with the same temperature, for each mutation after 
sampling of individuals (10 ind/deme x 100 demes) and filtering MAF > 0.01

* Allele frequency as a function of temperature for each mutation
* rows are temperature values
* columns are mutations in `seed_Rout_muts_full.txt`
