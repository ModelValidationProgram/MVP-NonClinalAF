## `summary_LAcalc_20220428_20220726.txt` 

This data summarizes the amount of local adaptation in different sets of loci.

-------------------------
### Outputs
-------------------------
* "LAcalc_SLiM" This is the local adaptation calculated in SLiM (all loci and all individuals)
* "LAcalc_1000ind_allmuts" This is the local adaptation calculated from all loci in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_NoMAFmuts" This is the local adaptation calculated from loci with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_ClinalMuts" This is the local adaptation calculated from clinal loci in both environments with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_ClinalMutsLFMM" This is the local adaptation calculated from LFMM outliers in both environments with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_NonClinalMuts" This is the local adaptation calculated from non-clinal loci in both environments with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_RandomMuts_nClinal" This is the local adaptation calculated from a random set of loci (the number equal to the number of clinal loci) with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_RandomMuts_nNonClinal" This is the local adaptation calculated from a random set of loci (the number equal to the number of non clinal loci) with MAF > 0.01 in the subset of 1000 individuals
* "LAcalc_1000ind_nClinal" The number of clinal loci used in the calculation
* "LAcalc_1000ind_nNonClinal" The number of non-clinal loci used in the calculation
* "seed"
